# RF_data_transmitter_and_receiver
The main aim of this project is to construct a short-range (min:5m) RF DATA
transmitter operating at 2.2MHz center frequency and receiver device.

### Modulation Method
Amplitude Modulation has been used. 
 
 ## Circuitry parts
 ### Colpits Oscillator
 With a center frequency 2.2MHz Colpits oscillator design with a buffer.
